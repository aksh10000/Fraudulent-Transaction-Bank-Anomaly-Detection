# Fraudulent-Transaction-Bank-Anomaly-Detection
I had used two anomaly detection models, i.e. Isolation Forest(accuracy 99.776%) and Local Outlier Factor(accuracy 99.772%) for anomaly detection and then compared these two anomaly detection models with logistic regression(accuracy 99.90%). 

Dataset was too large to be uploaded here. 

Dataset is available on my drive to be downloaded:
